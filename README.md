## Introduction 🐱‍💻
- Meteocast is a React-based weather forecasting application leveraging the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/"> **OpenWeather API** </a> to provide detailed weather updates for any location. Users can view real-time data, including temperature, sunrise and sunset times, wind speed and direction, pressure, humidity, and atmospheric conditions. Additionally, it features a five-day forecast for the selected location, accompanied by a graphical representation of daily temperature trends using <a href="https://recharts.org/en-US/"> **Recharts** </a>.

- The application includes a search functionality that allows users to find specific locations and add them to their list of favourites. Favourite locations are conveniently displayed on the homepage for quick access. Each location also has a dedicated page that provides the same detailed weather information and features as mentioned above.

- The application also has a dark mode and it has a refresh functionality to see the latest weather details.
